                        &nbsp;&nbsp; Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is
                        a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence
                        of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp; Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must first decide on an
                            argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey
                            to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should
                            remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph.
                            A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole process is an organic
                            one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.
